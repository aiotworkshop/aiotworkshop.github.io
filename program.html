											The exponential growth of data demands significantly higher processing performance, lower energy dissipation, and better system scalability. Limitations of the existing Von Neumann architecture and barriers such as memory bandwidth, heat density, etc. of today’s CMOS based computing technologies are prohibiting our computing platforms from meeting future data analytics and edge computing requirements. These limitations have motivated emerging research areas in new computing architectures (e.g. unified memory-computing architectures) with new devices (e.g. memristive devices). A memristor-based computing architecture focuses on the realization of the matrix-vector multiplication approximation using memristor crossbar arrays, which can naturally transfer the weighted (stored in the memristor arrays) combination of input voltage levels/spikes to output voltages levels/spikes. Designs based on this new architecture have been demonstrated in labs to enable both signal processing and deep neural networks applications with orders of magnitude energy-speed improvement over the CMOS counterparts.

											The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly approaching technological change that envisions ubiquitous and network-accessible digital instrumentation and actuation of literally every "thing" we encounter in everyday life.  Like the World Wide Web (now simply called The Internet) before it, IoT will likely represent another societal sea change as objects in the physical world become network-enabled so that they can communicate and interact with people and, autonomously, with each other.
										</p>
										<p>
											This technological vision also carries with it significant new challenges.  With estimates of between 50 billion and 1 trillion network-connected IoT devices in the next 20 years, the energy efficiency of these devices and the network technologies that interconnect them is paramount to their utility.  Moreover, the current Internet architecture, which is evolving to accommodate cloud computing, will require substantial additional innovation and augmentation before IoT will come to complete fruition.
										</p>
										<p>
											In this talk, we will discuss some of the computer science research questions that have grown from early experiences in architecting and deploying working IoT systems and infrastructure.  In particular, the talk will focus on a new approach to software infrastructure that is designed to meet many of the current and future IoT challenges.

                                        <br />
                                        Software Analytics focuses on utilizing data-driven approaches to help improve the quality of software systems, the user experience of interacting with software systems, and the productivity of software development process. Software Analytics is an important research area in the software engineering community for more than a decade. It has already made broad impact in software industry. As the computing paradigm was shifting towards cloud computing, we started to focus our Software Analytics research on cloud computing and created the research topic Cloud Intelligence. Cloud Intelligence targets at utilizing AI/ML technologies to help design, build, and operate high-quality and high-efficiency cloud systems at scale. Due to the distributed nature, great complexity, and enormous scale of cloud systems, Cloud Intelligence presents unique challenges and opportunities to the Software Analytics research. In this talk, I will first introduce the research landscape of software analytics and Cloud Intelligence. Then using a couple of projects as examples, I will talk about our research on Cloud Intelligence and its impact, as well as the research challenges and opportunities in Cloud Intelligence moving forward.

                                                IT operations are important techniques for ensuring our increasingly digitalized world run reliably, efficiently and safely, yet current IT Operations are labor-intensive, very stressful, and ineffective. In this talk, I will first explain why AI is necessary for IT Operations. I will then present a suite of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms for time series, log, and trace data, followed by the lessons learned. I will conclude my talk by envisioning that future IT Operations will become more and more autonomous, which will enable an even better digitalized world.

                                                <br />
                                                Operation engineers and developers highly rely on trace analysis to understand architectures and diagnose various problems such as service failures and quality degradation. However, the huge number of traces produced at runtime makes it challenging to capture the required information in real-time. In this talk, I will present two recent works collaborating with industrial partners, GMTA and MicroHECL, on large-scale trace analysis for microservice architecture understanding and fault analysis. Built on a graph-based representation, GMTA abstracts traces into different paths and further groups them into business flows and supports various analytical applications based on an efficient storage and access mechanism. MicroHECL is a high-efficient root cause localization approach for availability issues of microservice systems. It analyzes possible anomaly propagation chains, and ranks candidate root causes based on correlation analysis. Both the two works have been applied in the production systems of our industrial partners.

                                                <br />
                                                Cloud services are increasingly adopting new programming models, such as microservices and serverless compute. While these frameworks offer several advantages, such as better modularity, ease of maintenance and deployment, they also introduce new hardware and software challenges.  
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                In this talk, I will briefly discuss the challenges that these new cloud models introduce in hardware and software, and present some of our work on employing ML to improve the cloud’s performance predictability and resource efficiency. I will first discuss Seer, a performance debugging system that identifies root causes of unpredictable performance in multi-tier interactive microservices, and Sage, which improves on Seer by taking a completely unsupervised learning approach to data-driven performance debugging, making it both practical and scalable.

                                                Talk Abstract
                                                <br />
                                                The vision of self-aware, self-healing and self-managing Information Technology (IT) systems has remained elusive till recently. Recent advancements in Cloud computing, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, are all making it possible to realize this vision now. AI can optimize IT operations management processes by increasing application availability, predicting and detecting problems early, reducing the time it takes to resolve problems, proactively avoiding problems, and optimizing the resources and cost of running business applications on hybrid Clouds. In this talk, I will discuss the opportunity for AI to optimize IT Operations Management. I will describe how semi-structured application and infrastructure logs can be analyzed to predict anomalies early, how entities can be extracted and linked from logs, alerts and events to reduce alert noise for IT operations admins, how NLP can be put to use on unstructured content in prior incident tickets to extract next-best-action recommendations to resolve problems, and how deployment change request descriptions can be analyzed in combination with past incident root cause information to predict risks of deployment changes to prevent issues from happening in the first place.

While he began working on the lower layers of Exchange Server stack such as indexing, data storage, high availability, disaster recovery, and other bits of deep plumbing, as Office moved to the cloud so did he. He helped establish the architecture and implementation of O365 as both a hosted service and a self-hosted piece of enterprise software, started new technology initiatives such as the project that eventual became the Microsoft Graph and the advanced machine learning efforts that enable user action prediction like focused inbox, and regularly carried the ‘incident manager’ pager helping pragmatically assure the service was running correctly. Kleewein is listed as inventor of dozens of patents in the area of electronic communications, databases, data analytics, and hyper-scale cloud services. He is currently director of development for the core O365 hosted services, leading the worldwide team responsible for delivering Office productivity services to hundreds of millions of people every hour of every day.
