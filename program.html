												Kenneth Tran is the founder and CEO of Koidra Inc. Before Koidra, Kenneth was a Principal Applied Scientist in the Machine Learning Group, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/" target="_blank">Microsoft Research</a> (MSR). While at MSR, he led the Sonoma team, winning the first autonomous greenhouse challenge (2018), becoming the only AI team that outperformed expert Dutch growers. He recently led the Koala team comprised of Koidra and Cornell University researchers to win the first phase of the 3rd autonomous greenhouse challenge in 2021.Koala outperformed 46 teams from 24 countries in both the virtual net profit and overall ranking.
											</p>
											<p>
												Ken's research expertise and experience include Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Optimization, and Distributed Computing. At Microsoft, he led the research and development for strategic AI projects such as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/deep-reinforcement-learning-for-operational-optimal-control/" target="_blank">Deep Reinforcement Learning</a> for real-world control problems, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/" target="_blank">Computer Vision API for Cognitive Services</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/competition-win-a-steppingstone-in-the-greater-journey-to-create-sustainable-farming/" target="_blank">Autonomous Greenhouses</a>.

												Kenneth received his Ph.D. in Computational & Applied Mathematics from The University of Texas at Austin in 2012. 
											</p>

												Abstract: AIoT holds a great promise to disrupt greenhouse agriculture as well as operational control in manufacturing in general. Optimizing the conditions for plant growth is one of the most challenging operational control problems because it involves biological processes which we humans still don’t know much about. For this talk, I'll present: 1) The case of autonomous greenhouses using AIoT, in which I have won the international autonomous greenhouse challenges twice (in 2018 & 2021) and also outperformed the expert growers; 2) How our team is tackling the challenges in operational control in greenhouses and propose a unified framework for solving these issues with AIoT.

												Yves Miehe won the third place in <a href="https://location20.xyz10.com/" target="_blank">Indoor Location Competition 2.0</a>. Yves is a research and development engineer, focused on simulation. He has worked for several years in an insurance company as a flood model engineer, and for several car and engine companies. He is now working at MCE-5 development, a small company based in Lyon, France, where he simulates the combustion of engines, and the behavior of several components for the engine. He invented several patents to improve the fuel consumption of combustion engines, one of which is currently being developed as a prototype by the company. Yves had his engineer degree in year 2001 at Ecole Centrale Paris. He got interested by statistics and modeling in his various professional experiences, and discovered Kaggle in 2015 for a driver analysis competition. Despite not being a data scientist, his simulation experiences enable him to find solutions on Kaggle data science competitions. After 12 entertaining competitions, including 6 gold medals, he got the title of “competition grand master” at the end of the Indoor location competition.
