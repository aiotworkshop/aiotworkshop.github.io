											The exponential growth of data demands significantly higher processing performance, lower energy dissipation, and better system scalability. Limitations of the existing Von Neumann architecture and barriers such as memory bandwidth, heat density, etc. of today’s CMOS based computing technologies are prohibiting our computing platforms from meeting future data analytics and edge computing requirements. These limitations have motivated emerging research areas in new computing architectures (e.g. unified memory-computing architectures) with new devices (e.g. memristive devices). A memristor-based computing architecture focuses on the realization of the matrix-vector multiplication approximation using memristor crossbar arrays, which can naturally transfer the weighted (stored in the memristor arrays) combination of input voltage levels/spikes to output voltages levels/spikes. Designs based on this new architecture have been demonstrated in labs to enable both signal processing and deep neural networks applications with orders of magnitude energy-speed improvement over the CMOS counterparts.

											The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly approaching technological change that envisions ubiquitous and network-accessible digital instrumentation and actuation of literally every "thing" we encounter in everyday life.  Like the World Wide Web (now simply called The Internet) before it, IoT will likely represent another societal sea change as objects in the physical world become network-enabled so that they can communicate and interact with people and, autonomously, with each other.
										</p>
										<p>
											This technological vision also carries with it significant new challenges.  With estimates of between 50 billion and 1 trillion network-connected IoT devices in the next 20 years, the energy efficiency of these devices and the network technologies that interconnect them is paramount to their utility.  Moreover, the current Internet architecture, which is evolving to accommodate cloud computing, will require substantial additional innovation and augmentation before IoT will come to complete fruition.
										</p>
										<p>
											In this talk, we will discuss some of the computer science research questions that have grown from early experiences in architecting and deploying working IoT systems and infrastructure.  In particular, the talk will focus on a new approach to software infrastructure that is designed to meet many of the current and future IoT challenges.

                                        As Data Science advances and increasingly large amounts of data become readily available via various Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) projects, the energy industry is going through a digital transformation to unlock opportunities. In this talk, I will provide an overview and share two case studies of Digital Transformation enabled by Data Science R&D (1) Manufacturing Data Lake– efficient access to global manufacturing data (2) DEEVA: a deep learning and IoT based computer vision system to address safety and security of production sites.

                                                <br />
                                                Cloud services are increasingly adopting new programming models, such as microservices and serverless compute. While these frameworks offer several advantages, such as better modularity, ease of maintenance and deployment, they also introduce new hardware and software challenges.  
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                In this talk, I will briefly discuss the challenges that these new cloud models introduce in hardware and software, and present some of our work on employing ML to improve the cloud’s performance predictability and resource efficiency. I will first discuss Seer, a performance debugging system that identifies root causes of unpredictable performance in multi-tier interactive microservices, and Sage, which improves on Seer by taking a completely unsupervised learning approach to data-driven performance debugging, making it both practical and scalable.

AI Operations is about optimizing information technology (IT) operations management using Artificial Intelligence (AI). Prior to this role, Rama led the AI mission of enabling natural, personalized, and compassionate conversations between computers and humans where she and her team developed and delivered several differentiating AI Services such as Personality Insights, Tone Analyzer, Emotion Analysis, and Sentiment Analysis services to the IBM Watson platform. Before this, Rama led various projects and Research teams at IBM Watson Research Center and IBM Almaden Research Center in the areas of AI, analytics, business process optimization and delivered innovative analytical assets to IBM’s Global Business Services (GBS), and Global Technology Services (GTS) organizations. Rama has been named by Forbes as one of the ‘Top 20 Women in AI Research’ in May 2017, has been featured in ‘A-Team in AI’ by Fortune magazine in July 2018, and named ‘Top 10 pioneering women in AI and Machine Learning’ by Enterprise Management 360 in April 2019. Rama is also the recipient of the University of California, Berkeley’s Athena award for Technical and Executive Leadership for 2020.

                                                <br />
                                                The vision of self-aware, self-healing and self-managing Information Technology (IT) systems has remained elusive till recently. Recent advancements in Cloud computing, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, are all making it possible to realize this vision now. AI can optimize IT operations management processes by increasing application availability, predicting and detecting problems early, reducing the time it takes to resolve problems, proactively avoiding problems, and optimizing the resources and cost of running business applications on hybrid Clouds. In this talk, I will discuss the opportunity for AI to optimize IT Operations Management. I will describe how semi-structured application and infrastructure logs can be analyzed to predict anomalies early, how entities can be extracted and linked from logs, alerts and events to reduce alert noise for IT operations admins, how NLP can be put to use on unstructured content in prior incident tickets to extract next-best-action recommendations to resolve problems, and how deployment change request descriptions can be analyzed in combination with past incident root cause information to predict risks of deployment changes to prevent issues from happening in the first place.

While he began working on the lower layers of Exchange Server stack such as indexing, data storage, high availability, disaster recovery, and other bits of deep plumbing, as Office moved to the cloud so did he. He helped establish the architecture and implementation of O365 as both a hosted service and a self-hosted piece of enterprise software, started new technology initiatives such as the project that eventual became the Microsoft Graph and the advanced machine learning efforts that enable user action prediction like focused inbox, and regularly carried the ‘incident manager’ pager helping pragmatically assure the service was running correctly. Kleewein is listed as inventor of dozens of patents in the area of electronic communications, databases, data analytics, and hyper-scale cloud services. He is currently director of development for the core O365 hosted services, leading the worldwide team responsible for delivering Office productivity services to hundreds of millions of people every hour of every day.
