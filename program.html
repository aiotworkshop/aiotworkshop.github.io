											The exponential growth of data demands significantly higher processing performance, lower energy dissipation, and better system scalability. Limitations of the existing Von Neumann architecture and barriers such as memory bandwidth, heat density, etc. of today’s CMOS based computing technologies are prohibiting our computing platforms from meeting future data analytics and edge computing requirements. These limitations have motivated emerging research areas in new computing architectures (e.g. unified memory-computing architectures) with new devices (e.g. memristive devices). A memristor-based computing architecture focuses on the realization of the matrix-vector multiplication approximation using memristor crossbar arrays, which can naturally transfer the weighted (stored in the memristor arrays) combination of input voltage levels/spikes to output voltages levels/spikes. Designs based on this new architecture have been demonstrated in labs to enable both signal processing and deep neural networks applications with orders of magnitude energy-speed improvement over the CMOS counterparts.

											The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly approaching technological change that envisions ubiquitous and network-accessible digital instrumentation and actuation of literally every "thing" we encounter in everyday life.  Like the World Wide Web (now simply called The Internet) before it, IoT will likely represent another societal sea change as objects in the physical world become network-enabled so that they can communicate and interact with people and, autonomously, with each other.
										</p>
										<p>
											This technological vision also carries with it significant new challenges.  With estimates of between 50 billion and 1 trillion network-connected IoT devices in the next 20 years, the energy efficiency of these devices and the network technologies that interconnect them is paramount to their utility.  Moreover, the current Internet architecture, which is evolving to accommodate cloud computing, will require substantial additional innovation and augmentation before IoT will come to complete fruition.
										</p>
										<p>
											In this talk, we will discuss some of the computer science research questions that have grown from early experiences in architecting and deploying working IoT systems and infrastructure.  In particular, the talk will focus on a new approach to software infrastructure that is designed to meet many of the current and future IoT challenges.

                                        As Data Science advances and increasingly large amounts of data become readily available via various Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) projects, the energy industry is going through a digital transformation to unlock opportunities. In this talk, I will provide an overview and share two case studies of Digital Transformation enabled by Data Science R&D (1) Manufacturing Data Lake– efficient access to global manufacturing data (2) DEEVA: a deep learning and IoT based computer vision system to address safety and security of production sites.

He has worked for several years in an insurance company as a flood model engineer, and for several car and engine companies. He is now working at MCE-5 development, a small company based in Lyon, France, where he simulates the combustion of engines, and the behavior of several components for the engine. He invented several patents to improve the fuel consumption of combustion engines, one of which is currently being developed as a prototype by the company. Yves had his engineer degree in year 2001 at Ecole Centrale Paris. He got interested by statistics and modeling in his various professional experiences, and discovered Kaggle in 2015 for a driver analysis competition. Despite not being a data scientist, his simulation experiences enable him to find solutions on Kaggle data science competitions. After 12 entertaining competitions, including 6 gold medals, he got the title of “competition grand master” at the end of the Indoor location competition.
