									Data-driven techniques help boost agricultural productivity by increasing
									yields, reducing losses and cutting down input
									costs. However, these techniques have seen sparse adoption owing to high costs
									of manual data collection and limited
									connectivity solutions. Our system, called FarmBeats, includes Cloud, IoT & AI
									innovations for agriculture that enables
									seamless collection and analysis of data across various sensors, cameras,
									drones, and satellites. In this talk, we will
									describe the system, and outline some of the AI challenges we are currently
									addressing for agriculture.

								<p>
									Machine learning (ML) applications have entered and impacted our lives unlike
									any other technology advance from the
									recent past. Indeed, almost every aspect of how we live or interact with others
									relies on or uses ML for applications
									ranging from image classification and object detection, to processing
									multi‐modal and heterogeneous datasets. While the
									holy grail for judging the quality of a ML model has largely been serving
									accuracy, and only recently its resource
									usage, neither of these metrics translate directly to energy efficiency,
									runtime, or mobile device battery lifetime.
									This talk will uncover the need for building accurate, platform‐specific power
									and latency models for convolutional
									neural networks (CNNs) and efficient hardware-aware CNN design methodologies,
									thus allowing machine learners and
									hardware designers to identify not just the best accuracy NN configuration, but
									also those that satisfy given hardware
									constraints.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our proposed modeling framework is applicable to both high‐end and mobile
									platforms and achieves 88.24%
									accuracy for latency, 88.34% for power, and 97.21% for energy prediction. Using
									similar predictive models, we
									demonstrate a novel differentiable neural architecture search (NAS) framework,
									dubbed Single-Path NAS, that uses one
									single-path over-parameterized CNN to encode all architectural decisions based
									on shared convolutional kernel
									parameters. Single-Path NAS achieves state-of-the-art top-1 ImageNet accuracy
									(75.62%), outperforming existing mobile
									NAS methods for similar latency constraints (∼80ms) and finds the final
									configuration up to 5,000× faster compared to
									prior work. Combined with our quantized CNNs (Flexible Lightweight CNNs or
									FLightNNs) that customize precision level in
									a layer-wise fashion and achieve almost iso-accuracy at 5-10x energy reduction,
									such a modeling, analysis, and
									optimization framework is poised to lead to true co-design of hardware and ML
									model, orders of magnitude faster than
									state of the art, while satisfying both accuracy and latency or energy
									constraints.

									The field of AIoT (or AI of Things) is about making real-world impact through
									learning and decision making from sensor
									data. Although deep-learning based AI has made amazing breakthroughs in computer
									vision, natural language processing,
									machine translation, and gaming, when applied to real world problems, it faces a
									number of challenges from data, models,
									to systems. In this talk, we use ambient intelligent environments to motivate
									these challenges and present a few ideas
									to address them. We will discuss how multi-modality sensor fusion can overcome
									the limitation of single sensor types;
									how to use simulation to generate useful training data; and how to use neural
									architecture search to optimize the models
									for embedded platforms. These are initial work that scratches the surface of a
									complex field. We will discuss a few
									future research directions towards the end.
